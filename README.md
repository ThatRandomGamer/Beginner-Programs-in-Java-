# Beginner-Programs-in-Java-
This is a place to showcase some beginner java coding projects and exercises that I have made and others can use to learn from.

Current list of programs are:
1. A console based calculator that takes in firstNum and secondNum and an opperation and give the output. It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. just adding another switch case for % aka modulus will give the reminder. But I hardly search for that in a calculator so I didnt add it.

2. A fortune cookie generator! Press start and the console will display one of many fortunes that I wrote and tottaly didnt copy paste. It has a few easter eggs too.

3. A dice rolling program. Uses the random class and pressing start will roll the dice and a number from 1-6 will output
